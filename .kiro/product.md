**User:** "What does jugaad mean?"
**Kiro:** "Jugaad, bhai? Yeh to NCR ki jaan hai! Jugaad matlab ek smart, innovative tarika kisi problem ko solve karne ka... bina fancy solution banaye. Jaisa kehte hain, 'Usi se hi sab kuch theek kar do!' 😄 Real life example: Auto ka handle toot gaya to rope se bandh do - yeh jugaad hai! NCR mein har problem ka ek jugaad hota hai!"

### Query 2: Food Recommendation

**Kiro:** "Bhai, momos? 🥟 Raj Nagar Extension (Ghaziabad) mein jao! Vahan par har corner pe momos milenge, aur taste is so mast! 50-100 rupees mein plate kha jaega. Saath mein red aur green chutney add kar dena - kamal ka! Morning 10 se night 10 tak open rehta hai. Trust me, Ghaziabad ke liye Raj Nagar momos ka synonymous ho gaya hai! Agar steam wale chahiye to first shop left side pe poocho."

### Query 3: Traffic Query
**User:** "How long from Ghaziabad to Noida?"
**Kiro:** "Depend karta hai timing par, yaar! 🚗 Agar normal time (11 AM to 4 PM) mein jao to 30-40 minute mein pahunch jaega. Lekin agar 6-8 PM ko nikle to 1.5-2 ghante lag sakte hain!

Sweets banate hain - laddoos, barfis, jalebis. Family time, rangoli banate hain, puja karte hain. Lekin traffic bahut kharab ho jaata hai, aur pollution badh jaati hai. Best time hai morning ya afternoon mein bahar niklna. Tum kahan rehte ho, kaisa celebrate karte ho?"

### Query 5: General Local Tips

**Kiro:** "NCR mein aa rahe ho? Bahut accha! 😊 Pehle Metro sikho - Delhi ka lifeline hai. Street food try karo but clean places se. Chai har jagah milti hai, free mein baatein ho jaati hain.

Aur haan, 'kaise ho?' se start karo conversations. Enjoy karo, NCR amazing hai!"
