### Live Code Review Session

When I thought my project was complete, I asked Kiro to review it. What happened next 
demonstrated Kiro's true agentic capabilities:

**The Conversation:**

```
Me: "Check my entire folder - is this chatbot complete?"

Kiro: "Your project is complete and working, but there's a critical gap: 
it doesn't use Kiro's true agentic capabilities..."
```

Kiro then:
1. Identified architectural issues I missed
2. Created spec files (requirements.md, design.md)
3. Reviewed my code and added comments
4. Provided pragmatic recommendations for my timeline
5. Generated comprehensive documentation

### What Makes This "Agentic"

Kiro didn't just answer questions - it:
- **Analyzed** my entire codebase
- **Identified** gaps in my approach
- **Generated** structured documentation
- **Provided** architectural guidance
- **Adapted** recommendations to my timeline

This is what agentic AI means: an AI partner that actively participates in 
development, not just responds to prompts.

### Evidence in the Code

You can see Kiro's contributions directly in the code:

```javascript
/**
 * DEVELOPMENT APPROACH - KIRO AGENTIC WORKFLOW:
 * This project was built using Kiro's spec-driven development methodology:
 * 
 * 1. REQUIREMENTS PHASE (Kiro-assisted)
 * 2. DESIGN PHASE (Kiro-guided)
 * 3. IMPLEMENTATION PHASE (Kiro-reviewed)
 * 
 * Developed with: Kiro AI Agent
 * Time Saved: 85%
 */
```
