## How Kiro's Agentic Capabilities Accelerated Development

### The Kiro Difference

This project wasn't just built *with* Kiro - it was built *through* Kiro's 
agentic workflow. Here's how:

#### 1. Spec-Driven Development
Instead of jumping straight to code, I used Kiro's spec-driven approach:
- Kiro helped me structure requirements
- Generated comprehensive design documents
- Provided implementation guidance

[Screenshot: Requirements.md generated by Kiro]

#### 2. Architectural Review
When I thought my project was complete, Kiro identified a critical gap:
- My responses were template-based, not AI-generated
- Kiro explained the difference between static and agentic approaches
- Provided a solution path

[Screenshot: Kiro identifying the architectural issue]

#### 3. Iterative Refinement
Throughout development, Kiro provided:
- Code structure suggestions
- Error handling patterns
- Documentation improvements
- Quality assurance feedback

[Screenshot: Kiro chat showing iterative improvements]

#### 4. Evidence Collection
Kiro helped me document the entire process:
- Created evidence logs
- Generated workflow documentation
- Structured submission materials
